# AI Assistant Chatbot Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate a simple yet dynamic AI-powered chatbot into a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot provides an interactive interface, allowing users to send text-based messages and fill out a contact form to get in touch with you.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Chat Button**: A floating chatbot button that opens and closes the chat window with smooth animations.
- **Responsive Design**: The chatbot adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, offering a consistent user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **AI-Powered Communication**: It communicates with an external API to handle user messages and respond with relevant options in real-time.
- **Message Bubbles**: Messages from the user and bot are displayed in clean, visually appealing chat bubbles.
- **Button Options**: Supports interactive buttons for quick responses to enhance the flow of conversation.
- **Contact Form**: A built-in form allows users to submit their contact details directly through the chat interface.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Modern design principles are applied, featuring a gradient color scheme, hover effects, and smooth transitions for an engaging experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the chatbot interface, including animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Handles chatbot functionality, user interaction, and API communication.
- **Font Awesome**: Provides icons for the chatbot's user interface elements.

## How It Works

1. **Chat Activation**: Users can click the floating chat button to open or close the chat window. Smooth animations enhance the interaction.
